# Multivariate-Temperature-Forecasting-using-LSTM-Long-Short-term-Memory-
Multivariate Temperature forecasting is performed using sequential model like Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)/Long short-Term memory (LSTM). The objective is to train the model in such a way that the Mean Absolute Error will be minimum.
